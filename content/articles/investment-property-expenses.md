Owning an investment property can be a powerful wealth-building strategy, but it comes with ongoing costs that need careful tracking. Keeping accurate records of your expenses isn't just good practice — it's essential for claiming tax deductions and understanding your property's true performance.

## Common Investment Property Expenses

Here's a comprehensive list of the expenses most property investors encounter:

### Loan-Related Costs

| Expense | Typical Range | Tax Deductible? |
|---|---|---|
| Interest on investment loan | Varies by loan | Yes |
| Loan establishment fees | $0–$1,000 | Yes (spread over loan term or 5 years) |
| Ongoing loan fees | $0–$400/year | Yes |
| Mortgage insurance (LMI) | Varies | Yes (spread over 5 years or loan term) |

### Property Management

| Expense | Typical Range | Tax Deductible? |
|---|---|---|
| Property management fees | 5–10% of rent | Yes |
| Letting fees | 1–2 weeks rent | Yes |
| Advertising for tenants | $100–$500 | Yes |
| Lease preparation | $50–$200 | Yes |

### Insurance and Rates

| Expense | Typical Range | Tax Deductible? |
|---|---|---|
| Landlord insurance | $1,000–$2,500/year | Yes |
| Council rates | $1,000–$3,000/year | Yes |
| Water rates (fixed portion) | $200–$600/year | Yes |
| Body corporate/strata fees | $500–$5,000+/year | Yes |
| Land tax (if applicable) | Varies by state | Yes |

### Maintenance and Repairs

| Expense | Typical Range | Tax Deductible? |
|---|---|---|
| General repairs | Varies | Yes (if repair, not improvement) |
| Pest control | $200–$500/year | Yes |
| Gardening/lawn maintenance | $50–$150/visit | Yes |
| Cleaning between tenants | $200–$500 | Yes |

### Depreciation (Non-Cash Deductions)

You can claim depreciation on:

- **Building (capital works)**: For properties built after 1987, you can claim 2.5% of the construction cost per year
- **Fixtures and fittings**: Items like carpets, blinds, hot water systems, and appliances depreciate over their effective life

A **quantity surveyor's depreciation schedule** (costing $400–$800) can identify thousands of dollars in annual deductions you might otherwise miss.

## What You Should Track

For each expense, record:

- **Date** of the expense
- **Amount** paid
- **Category** (interest, management, insurance, repairs, etc.)
- **Description** of what it was for
- **Receipt or invoice** (keep digital copies)

## How to Organise Your Records

### Option 1: Spreadsheet

A simple spreadsheet works well for most investors. Set up columns for date, category, description, amount, and GST. Create a separate tab for each financial year and a summary tab that totals each category.

Key categories to track:

- Rental income received
- Loan interest
- Property management fees
- Insurance premiums
- Council and water rates
- Body corporate fees
- Repairs and maintenance
- Depreciation
- Travel to property (if applicable)
- Legal and accounting fees

### Option 2: Property Investment Apps

Several apps are designed specifically for Australian property investors and can automate much of the tracking. They sync with bank accounts, categorise expenses, and generate tax-ready reports.

### Option 3: Your Accountant

Many investors hand their records to their accountant at tax time. The better organised your records are, the less your accountant charges — and the less likely you are to miss deductions.

## Understanding Cashflow vs Tax Position

Your investment property has two financial pictures:

**Cashflow** = Rent received minus actual expenses paid

**Tax position** = Rent received minus all deductible expenses (including depreciation)

A property can be cashflow negative (costing you money each month) but still be a sound investment thanks to tax deductions, capital growth, and equity building.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Not keeping receipts**: The ATO can disallow deductions without proof
- **Confusing repairs with improvements**: A repair (fixing a broken tap) is immediately deductible. An improvement (renovating a bathroom) must be depreciated over time
- **Missing depreciation claims**: Many investors leave thousands on the table by not getting a depreciation schedule
- **Not separating personal and investment finances**: Use a dedicated bank account for your investment property
