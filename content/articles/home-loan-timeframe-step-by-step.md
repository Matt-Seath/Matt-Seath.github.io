One of the most common questions we hear is "how long does this all take?" Whether you're a first home buyer or refinancing, understanding the timeline helps you plan ahead and avoid surprises.

Here's a realistic step-by-step breakdown of the home loan process.

## Step 1: Initial Consultation (Day 1)

**Duration: 30–60 minutes**

This is where we get to know your financial situation, goals, and preferences. We'll discuss:

- Your income, expenses, and existing debts
- How much you can borrow
- What type of loan suits your needs
- Any government grants or schemes you may be eligible for

This is a free, no-obligation conversation — either in person, over the phone, or via video call.

## Step 2: Pre-Approval (1–5 Business Days)

**Duration: Typically 1–5 business days after submission**

Once we've identified the right lender and product, we submit a pre-approval application. This gives you a conditional approval for a set borrowing amount, so you can shop for property with confidence.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Identification (driver's licence, passport)
- Payslips or proof of income (last 2–3 months)
- Bank statements (last 3 months)
- Details of any existing debts
- Employment details

Pre-approval typically lasts 3–6 months, depending on the lender.

## Step 3: Property Search (Varies)

**Duration: Days to months — this is up to you**

With pre-approval in hand, you can attend inspections, make offers, and bid at auctions knowing your budget. This step is entirely in your control.

## Step 4: Formal Application (1–3 Days to Prepare)

**Duration: 1–3 days to compile and submit**

Once you've found a property and had your offer accepted (or won at auction), we submit your formal loan application. This includes:

- The signed contract of sale
- Updated financial documents (if needed)
- Property details for the lender's valuation

We handle the paperwork and submission for you.

## Step 5: Lender Assessment and Valuation (5–10 Business Days)

**Duration: Typically 5–10 business days**

The lender reviews your application, verifies your documents, and orders a property valuation. This is usually the longest step and can vary by lender. Some lenders are faster than others — we factor turnaround times into our lender recommendation.

During this step, the lender may come back with questions or request additional documents. We manage this communication so you don't have to chase anyone.

## Step 6: Formal (Unconditional) Approval (1–2 Business Days)

**Duration: 1–2 business days after assessment**

Once the lender is satisfied, they issue formal approval. This means your loan is approved and you can proceed to settlement. You'll receive your loan documents to review and sign.

## Step 7: Loan Document Signing (1–3 Days)

**Duration: 1–3 days**

You'll receive your loan contract and mortgage documents. Review them carefully (we'll walk you through anything unclear), sign them, and return them to the lender. Many lenders now offer digital signing.

## Step 8: Settlement (Typically 4–6 Weeks From Contract)

**Duration: Settlement date is set in your contract of sale**

Settlement is the day ownership officially transfers to you. Your lender pays the seller, the title is transferred, and you get the keys.

The settlement date is usually set in the contract of sale — typically 30–42 days from exchange, though it can be negotiated.

## Total Timeline Summary

| Step | Typical Duration |
|---|---|
| Initial consultation | Day 1 |
| Pre-approval | 1–5 business days |
| Property search | Varies |
| Formal application | 1–3 days to submit |
| Lender assessment & valuation | 5–10 business days |
| Formal approval | 1–2 business days |
| Document signing | 1–3 days |
| Settlement | As per contract (usually 30–42 days) |

**From offer accepted to settlement: typically 4–8 weeks.**

## Tips to Keep Things Moving Quickly

- **Get pre-approved first**: This avoids delays when you find a property
- **Have your documents ready**: Gather payslips, bank statements, and ID early
- **Respond to requests promptly**: If the lender asks for additional info, the faster you respond, the faster they process
- **Use a broker**: We know which lenders are fast and which are slow — and we manage the process to keep things on track
