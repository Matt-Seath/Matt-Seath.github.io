For most Australians, saving a home deposit is the single biggest barrier to getting into the property market. With property prices where they are, even a 10% deposit can feel like a mountain to climb. But with the right strategy, it's more achievable than you might think.

## How Much Do You Actually Need?

The traditional advice is to save 20% of the purchase price to avoid paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI). On a $600,000 property, that's $120,000 — plus you'll need extra for stamp duty, legal fees, and other costs.

However, many buyers purchase with far less:

- **5% deposit**: Possible through the Home Guarantee Scheme (no LMI required)
- **10% deposit**: A common starting point, though LMI will apply
- **20% deposit**: Avoids LMI entirely and often unlocks better interest rates

## 7 Strategies to Build Your Deposit Faster

### 1. Set a Clear Target and Timeline

Work backwards from the property price you're aiming for. Knowing exactly how much you need and by when makes it easier to create a realistic savings plan.

### 2. Open a Dedicated Savings Account

Keep your deposit separate from your everyday spending in a high-interest savings account. Out of sight, out of mind — and earning interest.

### 3. Automate Your Savings

Set up an automatic transfer on payday so the money moves before you have a chance to spend it. Even small, consistent amounts add up over time.

### 4. Reduce Your Biggest Expenses

Housing and transport are typically the two largest expenses. Consider whether downsizing your rental, getting a housemate, or reducing car costs could free up extra savings.

### 5. Use the First Home Super Saver Scheme

The FHSSS allows you to make voluntary super contributions (up to $15,000 per year, $50,000 total) and withdraw them later for your deposit. The tax benefits can boost your savings by thousands compared to a regular savings account.

### 6. Look Into Government Grants

Depending on your state and whether you're buying new or established, you may be eligible for:

- **First Home Owner Grant**: Up to $30,000 in some states for new builds
- **Stamp duty concessions**: Reduced or waived stamp duty for first home buyers
- **Home Guarantee Scheme**: Buy with as little as 5% deposit, no LMI

### 7. Pick Up Extra Income

A side hustle, overtime, or selling unused items can accelerate your savings. Directing any windfalls (tax returns, bonuses) straight into your deposit fund helps too.

## Don't Forget the Extra Costs

Your deposit isn't the only upfront cost. Budget for:

- **Stamp duty**: Varies by state and property value (unless you qualify for an exemption)
- **Conveyancing fees**: $1,000–$3,000
- **Building and pest inspection**: $400–$800
- **Loan application fees**: Varies by lender
- **Moving costs**: Removalists, connections, etc.

A good rule of thumb is to budget an extra 3-5% of the purchase price for these costs on top of your deposit.
