Whether you're selling to upgrade, downsize, or free up equity for your next investment, how you present your property can significantly impact the price you achieve. A well-prepared home attracts more buyers, generates stronger offers, and often sells faster.

## First Impressions Matter

Buyers form an opinion within seconds of seeing your property — both online and in person. Focus your efforts on the areas that create the strongest first impression.

### Street Appeal

- **Front garden**: Mow the lawn, trim hedges, add fresh mulch or a few potted plants
- **Entrance**: Clean the front door, replace a worn doormat, and make sure the house number is visible
- **Exterior**: Pressure-wash driveways and paths, touch up any peeling paint
- **Lighting**: Ensure outdoor lights work — many buyers drive by in the evening

### Interior Presentation

- **Declutter**: Remove excess furniture, personal items, and anything that makes rooms feel smaller
- **Deep clean**: Every surface matters — floors, windows, kitchens, bathrooms, and light fittings
- **Neutral tones**: A fresh coat of paint in a neutral colour can transform a space
- **Repairs**: Fix anything obviously broken — leaky taps, cracked tiles, sticking doors

## Renovations Worth Considering

Not every renovation adds value. Focus on changes that offer the best return:

| Improvement | Typical Cost | Potential Return |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fresh paint (interior) | $3,000–$8,000 | High |
| Kitchen update (cosmetic) | $5,000–$15,000 | High |
| Bathroom refresh | $5,000–$15,000 | Medium-High |
| New flooring | $3,000–$10,000 | Medium-High |
| Landscaping | $2,000–$5,000 | High |
| Styling/staging | $2,000–$5,000 | High |

Avoid over-capitalising — spend only what you're confident you'll recoup through a higher sale price. Your real estate agent can advise on what improvements will matter most in your area.

## Professional Styling

Property styling (or staging) involves furnishing and decorating your home to appeal to the broadest range of buyers. Styled properties consistently achieve higher sale prices and spend fewer days on market.

Even partial styling — focusing on key rooms like the living area, master bedroom, and outdoor entertaining space — can make a noticeable difference.

## Getting Your Finance Sorted Before You Sell

If you're selling to buy your next property, getting your finance pre-approved before listing is crucial. This allows you to:

- **Know your budget** for the next purchase
- **Move quickly** when you find the right property
- **Coordinate settlement** between the sale and purchase
- **Explore bridging finance** if needed
