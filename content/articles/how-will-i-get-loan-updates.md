Applying for a home loan can feel like a waiting game — especially when there's a property on the line. Not knowing where your application stands is stressful, which is why clear and consistent communication is one of the most important things a mortgage broker can offer.

Here's what you can expect when you work with us.

## We Keep You Informed at Every Stage

From the moment we submit your application, you'll never be left wondering what's happening. Here's how we communicate throughout the process:

### Pre-Approval Stage

Once your pre-approval is submitted, we'll let you know:

- Confirmation that your application has been received by the lender
- If the lender has any questions or needs additional documents
- When your pre-approval has been issued and what it means

### Formal Application Stage

After you've found a property and we've submitted your formal application:

- **Submission confirmation**: We'll confirm the application is lodged and outline the expected timeline
- **Valuation update**: We'll let you know when the property valuation has been ordered and when the report comes back
- **Assessor queries**: If the lender's credit assessor needs anything extra, we'll contact you right away with clear instructions on what's needed
- **Approval notification**: The moment we receive formal approval, you'll be the first to know

### Settlement Stage

As settlement approaches:

- We'll confirm the settlement date and what to expect
- We'll coordinate with your solicitor or conveyancer
- We'll let you know when settlement has been completed

## How We Communicate

Everyone has their preferred way of staying in touch. We work with whatever suits you best:

- **Phone calls**: For important updates and milestones
- **Text messages**: Quick updates and confirmations
- **Email**: Detailed information, document requests, and written records
- **Video calls**: When we need to walk you through documents or discuss options

You'll also have your broker's direct mobile number — not a call centre.

## What You Can Expect From Us

- **Proactive updates**: We contact you with updates before you need to ask
- **Honest timelines**: We'll tell you realistic timeframes, not just what you want to hear
- **Quick responses**: If you reach out with a question, we aim to respond the same day
- **Plain English**: No jargon. We explain things clearly so you understand exactly where things stand

## What We Might Need From You

The process moves fastest when we work as a team. Occasionally, we may need you to:

- Provide additional documents the lender has requested (updated payslip, bank statement, etc.)
- Sign documents electronically or in person
- Confirm details about the property or your financial situation

The quicker you can respond to these requests, the faster your application progresses.

## After Settlement

Our relationship doesn't end at settlement. We'll:

- Check in after you've moved in to make sure everything is going smoothly
- Conduct regular reviews of your loan to make sure it's still competitive
- Be available whenever you have questions about your mortgage

## Why Communication Matters

A home loan is one of the biggest financial commitments you'll make. You deserve to know exactly what's happening at every step. Poor communication is one of the biggest complaints borrowers have about the lending process — and it's something we take seriously.
