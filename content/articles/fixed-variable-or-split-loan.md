Choosing between a fixed, variable, or split home loan rate is one of the biggest decisions you'll make when taking out a mortgage. There's no universally right answer — it depends on your financial situation, your risk tolerance, and what you think rates might do in the future.

## Variable Rate Loans

With a variable rate loan, your interest rate moves up and down with the market. When the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) changes the cash rate, your lender typically adjusts your rate accordingly.

### Pros

- **Flexibility**: Most variable loans allow unlimited extra repayments with no penalty
- **Offset accounts**: You can link an offset account to reduce the interest you pay
- **Redraw facility**: Access extra repayments you've made if you need the funds later
- **No break costs**: You can refinance or pay off your loan at any time without penalty

### Cons

- **Uncertainty**: Your repayments can increase if rates rise
- **Budgeting difficulty**: Monthly repayments may change, making it harder to plan
- **Rate increases can be sudden**: Multiple rate hikes in a short period can significantly increase costs

### Best For

Borrowers who value flexibility, have an offset account with a healthy balance, or believe rates may fall in the near term.

## Fixed Rate Loans

A fixed rate loan locks in your interest rate for a set period — typically 1 to 5 years. Your repayments stay the same regardless of what happens to the cash rate.

### Pros

- **Certainty**: You know exactly what your repayments will be for the fixed period
- **Protection from rate rises**: If rates go up, your rate stays the same
- **Easier budgeting**: Consistent repayments make financial planning simpler

### Cons

- **Break costs**: If you want to refinance, sell, or pay off the loan early during the fixed period, you may face significant break costs (potentially thousands of dollars)
- **Limited extra repayments**: Most fixed loans cap extra repayments at $10,000–$20,000 per year
- **No offset account**: Most fixed loans don't offer offset accounts (some lenders offer limited offset on fixed)
- **You miss out if rates fall**: If variable rates drop below your fixed rate, you're stuck paying more

### Best For

Borrowers who want predictability, are on a tight budget, or believe rates are likely to rise.

## Split Loans (Part Fixed, Part Variable)

A split loan divides your mortgage into two portions — one fixed and one variable. You choose the ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40, 70/30).

### Pros

- **Balanced approach**: You get some certainty from the fixed portion and flexibility from the variable portion
- **Partial offset benefit**: You can use an offset account on the variable portion
- **Reduced risk**: You're not fully exposed to rate movements in either direction
- **Some extra repayment flexibility**: Make unlimited extra repayments on the variable portion

### Cons

- **Complexity**: Managing two loan portions can be more complicated
- **Partial exposure**: You're still partially exposed to rate rises (on the variable portion) and partially locked in (on the fixed portion)
- **Break costs still apply**: If you refinance, you'll face break costs on the fixed portion

### Best For

Borrowers who want a middle ground — some certainty, some flexibility — or who are unsure about the rate outlook.

## Key Factors to Consider

### 1. Where Do You Think Rates Are Heading?

Nobody can predict rates perfectly, but consider the current environment:

- If rates are high and expected to fall → variable may benefit you
- If rates are low and expected to rise → fixing may protect you
- If you're unsure → a split loan hedges your bets

### 2. How Long Will You Hold the Loan?

- Planning to sell or refinance within 1–2 years? Variable gives you flexibility without break costs
- Staying put for 3–5 years? Fixing could offer valuable certainty

### 3. Do You Have an Offset Account?

If you keep significant savings in an offset account, a variable or split loan lets you benefit from that. Fixing your entire loan means losing offset benefits.

### 4. Do You Make Extra Repayments?

If you regularly put extra money into your mortgage, variable is more accommodating. Fixed loans typically limit extra repayments.

### 5. What's Your Risk Tolerance?

If the thought of your repayments increasing by $500 a month keeps you up at night, fixing some or all of your loan may give you peace of mind.

## A Practical Example

**Loan: $500,000**

| Strategy | Fixed Portion (4 years at 5.79%) | Variable Portion (at 6.09%) |
|---|---|---|
| 100% Variable | — | $500,000 |
| 100% Fixed | $500,000 | — |
| 50/50 Split | $250,000 | $250,000 |
| 70/30 Split | $350,000 | $150,000 |

With the 50/50 split, you'd have the certainty of fixed repayments on half your loan while maintaining offset and extra repayment flexibility on the other half.
