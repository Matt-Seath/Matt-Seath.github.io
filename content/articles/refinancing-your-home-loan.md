If you've had your home loan for a few years, there's a good chance you're paying more than you need to. Refinancing — switching your loan to a new lender or renegotiating with your current one — can potentially save you thousands of dollars.

## Signs It Might Be Time to Refinance

### Your Rate Is Above Market
Interest rates have changed significantly over the past few years. If your rate is noticeably higher than what new borrowers are getting, it's worth exploring your options.

### Your Financial Situation Has Changed
A pay rise, paying off a car loan, or simply having more equity in your home can all improve your borrowing position and qualify you for better rates.

### You Want to Access Equity
If your property has increased in value, you may be able to access that equity for renovations, investments, or other purposes.

### You Want Different Loan Features
Perhaps you want an offset account, a redraw facility, or the ability to make extra repayments without penalty.

## What to Consider Before Refinancing

- **Break costs**: If you're on a fixed rate, there may be significant break costs
- **Discharge fees**: Your current lender may charge a fee to close your loan
- **Application fees**: Some new lenders charge establishment or application fees
- **LMI**: If your loan-to-value ratio (LVR) is above 80%, you may need to pay Lenders Mortgage Insurance again

## The Refinancing Process

1. **Review your current loan**: Understand your rate, features, and any exit costs
2. **Compare options**: A broker can compare dozens of lenders for you
3. **Apply for the new loan**: Similar to your original application but often simpler
4. **Settlement**: The new lender pays out your old loan

The whole process typically takes 2-4 weeks.

## Is Refinancing Worth It?

As a rule of thumb, if you can save 0.5% or more on your interest rate and the savings outweigh any switching costs, refinancing is likely worthwhile.

For example, on a $500,000 loan, a 0.5% rate reduction could save you approximately $2,500 per year.
