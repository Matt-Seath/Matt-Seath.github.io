When buying property in Australia, you'll generally encounter two methods of sale: auction and private treaty (private sale). Each has its own process, advantages, and risks. Understanding both will help you feel confident no matter how the property you want is being sold.

## How Auctions Work

At an auction, buyers bid openly against each other on a set date. The property goes to the highest bidder once the reserve price (the seller's minimum acceptable price) is met.

### Key Features of Buying at Auction

- **No cooling-off period**: Once the hammer falls, the sale is legally binding in most states
- **Deposit paid on the day**: Typically 10% of the purchase price
- **Transparent pricing**: You can see exactly what others are willing to pay
- **Set timeline**: The auction date creates urgency and a clear deadline
- **Finance must be arranged beforehand**: You need unconditional approval before bidding

### Tips for Auction Buyers

1. **Get pre-approved** with unconditional finance before the auction
2. **Set a firm budget** and don't get caught up in bidding wars
3. **Attend other auctions first** to observe and build confidence
4. **Arrange building and pest inspections** before auction day — there's no time after
5. **Register to bid** on the day and bring valid identification

## How Private Sales Work

In a private sale, the property is listed at a set price (or price range). Buyers make offers to the seller's agent, and the seller decides whether to accept, reject, or counter-offer.

### Key Features of Private Sales

- **Cooling-off period**: Most states provide a cooling-off period (usually 3-5 business days) after signing the contract
- **Negotiation**: There's room to negotiate on price, settlement dates, and conditions
- **Conditions**: You can include conditions in your offer, such as "subject to finance" or "subject to building inspection"
- **More time**: The process is generally less rushed than an auction

### Tips for Private Sale Buyers

1. **Research comparable sales** in the area to make a competitive offer
2. **Include conditions** to protect yourself (finance, building inspection)
3. **Move quickly** if the property is popular — other buyers may also be making offers
4. **Get pre-approval** so you can move with confidence
5. **Use your broker** to confirm your borrowing capacity before making an offer

## Which Is Better?

Neither method is inherently better — it depends on the market, the property, and your situation.

| Factor | Auction | Private Sale |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Cooling-off period | No | Yes (most states) |
| Conditions (e.g. subject to finance) | No | Yes |
| Price transparency | High | Lower |
| Negotiation | Limited | More flexible |
| Timeline pressure | Higher | Lower |

**Choose auction if**: You're confident in your finance, have done your inspections, and want a transparent process.

**Choose private sale if**: You want more flexibility, need conditions in your contract, or prefer a less pressured process.

## Getting Finance-Ready

Whether you're buying at auction or by private sale, being finance-ready is essential. Pre-approval gives you a clear budget and shows sellers you're a serious buyer.
