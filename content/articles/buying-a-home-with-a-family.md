Buying a home for your family is one of the most meaningful financial decisions you'll make. Unlike buying your first apartment or investment property, a family home comes with a unique set of priorities — space, location, schools, safety, and room to grow. Here's how to approach it.

## What to Prioritise in a Family Home

### Location and Lifestyle

- **School catchments**: Research local schools and their catchment zones — this can significantly affect both your family's lifestyle and the property's value
- **Parks and playgrounds**: Outdoor spaces are essential for young families
- **Transport links**: Proximity to public transport, major roads, and your workplace
- **Safety**: Low-crime areas with good street lighting and pedestrian-friendly streets
- **Community**: Look for family-friendly neighbourhoods with other young families nearby

### Space and Layout

- **Bedrooms**: Think about how many you need now and in 5-10 years
- **Living areas**: Multiple living zones are valuable as children grow and need their own space
- **Outdoor space**: A backyard, even a small one, adds significant value for families
- **Storage**: Families accumulate a lot — built-in wardrobes, a garage, and shed space matter
- **Layout flow**: Open-plan living with sight lines to the backyard is ideal for supervising younger children

## Financial Considerations for Families

### Budgeting on a Family Income

If one parent plans to reduce their hours or take time off after having children, factor this into your borrowing calculation. Lenders assess your ability to repay based on your income at the time of application, but you need to make sure repayments remain comfortable if your household income drops.

### Parental Leave and Lending

Most lenders will consider an application from a borrower on parental leave, provided you can show:

- A return-to-work date
- Confirmation of your ongoing salary
- Evidence of any government or employer-paid leave

Your broker can guide you to lenders with the most favourable parental leave policies.

### Using Family Guarantees

Parents or in-laws can act as guarantors to help you buy sooner or buy a larger property. A family guarantee uses the equity in the guarantor's home as additional security, allowing you to borrow more or avoid LMI without a full 20% deposit.

This is a common arrangement for young families and, when structured correctly, can be released once you've built enough equity in your own home.

## Future-Proofing Your Purchase

- **Buy slightly more space than you need today**: It's cheaper than moving again in a few years
- **Consider renovation potential**: A property with room to extend or reconfigure can grow with your family
- **Check council zoning**: Ensure there are no planned developments nearby that could affect your amenity
- **Think about resale**: Even if you plan to stay long-term, buying in a desirable location protects your investment
