If you've been shopping around for a home loan — especially for a refinance — you've probably seen lenders advertising "cashback" offers. These promotions can put anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 back in your pocket just for switching. Sounds great, but is it really free money?

## How Cashback Offers Work

A lender cashback offer is a one-off payment made to you after you refinance your home loan (or sometimes take out a new loan) with that lender. It's essentially an incentive to win your business.

### Typical Terms

- **Amount**: Usually $2,000–$5,000 for refinances, though some offers go higher
- **Payment timing**: Typically paid within 60–90 days of settlement
- **Minimum loan amount**: Most require a minimum loan size (e.g., $250,000+)
- **New customers only**: Usually only available to borrowers switching from another lender
- **Time-limited**: Cashback offers come and go — they're promotional, not permanent

### How You Receive It

The cashback is usually deposited directly into your nominated bank account or your loan account after settlement. It's real cash — you can use it however you like.

## What to Watch Out For

### The Rate Still Matters Most

A $4,000 cashback sounds appealing, but if the loan's interest rate is 0.30% higher than a competitor without cashback, you could end up paying more over time.

**Example**: On a $500,000 loan, a 0.30% higher rate costs approximately $1,500 per year in extra interest. After about 2.5 years, the cashback is wiped out — and you're worse off from that point on.

Always compare the **total cost** of the loan (rate + fees - cashback) over the period you expect to hold it.

### Clawback Clauses

Some lenders include a clawback clause — meaning if you refinance away within a set period (usually 1–4 years), you may have to repay part or all of the cashback. Read the fine print.

### It May Not Cover All Switching Costs

While cashback can offset refinancing costs (discharge fees, registration fees, etc.), it may not cover everything — especially if you're breaking a fixed rate.

### Tax Implications

For owner-occupiers, cashback is generally not considered taxable income. However, for investment property loans, the ATO may treat the cashback as assessable income. Speak to your accountant about your specific situation.

## When a Cashback Offer Is Worth It

- The loan itself is competitive (good rate, suitable features)
- The cashback more than covers your switching costs
- You plan to stay with the lender long enough that any clawback period passes
- You've compared the total cost against loans without cashback

## When to Be Cautious

- The rate is higher than alternatives — the cashback is masking an expensive loan
- There's a long clawback period and you might want to refinance again soon
- The minimum loan amount is higher than what you need
- The loan lacks features you value (offset, extra repayments, etc.)

## A Smart Way to Evaluate Cashback

Here's a practical approach:

1. **Ignore the cashback** and compare the loan on its merits (rate, fees, features)
2. If the loan is competitive on its own, the cashback is genuinely a bonus
3. If the loan is only attractive because of the cashback, be cautious
4. Calculate the **net benefit** over 2–3 years: cashback minus any extra interest you'd pay compared to the cheapest alternative

## Current Cashback Trends

Cashback offers tend to be more prevalent when lenders are competing aggressively for refinance customers. They're often available from mid-tier and smaller lenders looking to grow their loan books, but the big four banks occasionally run them too.

Offers change frequently, so what's available today may differ from next month.
