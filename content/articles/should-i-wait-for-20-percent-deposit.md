One of the most common questions first home buyers ask is whether they should wait until they've saved a full 20% deposit before buying. The logic seems sound — a 20% deposit means you avoid paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI), which can cost thousands of dollars.

But waiting isn't always the best strategy. Here's why.

## What Is LMI and How Much Does It Cost?

Lenders Mortgage Insurance protects the lender (not you) if you default on your loan. It's required when you borrow more than 80% of the property's value — meaning your deposit is less than 20%.

LMI costs depend on your loan amount and LVR (loan-to-value ratio):

| Property Value | Deposit | LVR | Approximate LMI Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| $600,000 | $30,000 (5%) | 95% | $25,000–$35,000 |
| $600,000 | $60,000 (10%) | 90% | $10,000–$15,000 |
| $600,000 | $90,000 (15%) | 85% | $4,000–$7,000 |
| $600,000 | $120,000 (20%) | 80% | $0 |

LMI can often be added to the loan (capitalised), so you don't need to pay it upfront — but you'll pay interest on it over time.

## The Case for Waiting

- **You avoid a significant cost**: LMI at 90%+ LVR can add $10,000–$35,000 to your loan
- **Lower repayments**: A smaller loan means lower monthly repayments
- **Better interest rates**: Some lenders offer sharper rates at 80% LVR or below
- **Stronger borrowing position**: More equity from day one

## The Case Against Waiting

### Property Prices May Rise Faster Than You Can Save

This is the biggest risk. If property values increase by 5–10% per year in your target area, your 20% deposit goal keeps moving further away.

**Example**: You're saving for a $600,000 property and need $120,000 (20%). If prices grow 7% annually, that same property is worth $642,000 next year — and you'd now need $128,400. You may never catch up.

### The Cost of Rent While Waiting

Every month you spend renting is money that could be going toward your own mortgage. If you're paying $500 per week in rent, that's $26,000 per year that builds zero equity.

### You Miss Out on Capital Growth

If the property you buy today increases in value, that capital growth is yours — even if you paid LMI to get in the door. Buying earlier means you start building wealth sooner.

### Government Incentives Have Time Limits

First home buyer grants, stamp duty concessions, and schemes like the Home Guarantee Scheme (which lets you buy with as little as 5% deposit with no LMI) may not be available forever.

## When It Makes Sense to Buy with Less Than 20%

- Property prices in your area are rising steadily
- You have stable income and can comfortably manage repayments
- You qualify for a government guarantee scheme (no LMI with 5% deposit)
- The LMI cost is small relative to expected capital growth
- You've been renting for a long time and want to start building equity

## When It Makes Sense to Wait

- You're close to 20% and can reach it within 6–12 months
- The property market in your area is flat or declining
- Your income isn't stable enough to handle higher repayments
- You'd be stretched too thin after paying LMI

## The Home Guarantee Scheme

The Australian Government's Home Guarantee Scheme allows eligible first home buyers to purchase with as little as 5% deposit without paying LMI. The government guarantees the difference. This can be a game-changer — but places are limited each financial year.
