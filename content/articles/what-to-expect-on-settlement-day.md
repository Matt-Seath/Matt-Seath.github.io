You've found the perfect property, your loan has been approved, and the contracts are signed. Now comes settlement day — the final step where ownership officially transfers to you. But what actually happens on the day, and what do you need to do?

## What Is Settlement?

Settlement is the legal process where the property's title is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Your lender releases the funds to the seller's bank, and in return, you receive the keys to your new home.

In most states, settlement takes place 30-90 days after contracts are exchanged, depending on what was agreed in the contract of sale.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

Settlement involves several parties working together:

- **Your solicitor or conveyancer** prepares and reviews all legal documents
- **Your lender** arranges the transfer of funds
- **The seller's solicitor** confirms that all conditions have been met
- **Your state's land titles office** records the change of ownership

In most cases today, settlement is handled electronically through platforms like PEXA, which means the parties don't need to physically meet.

## Your Settlement Day Checklist

### Before Settlement

- **Final inspection**: Conduct a final walk-through of the property (usually the day before or morning of settlement) to make sure it's in the agreed condition
- **Confirm with your conveyancer**: Ensure all documents are signed and funds are in order
- **Arrange insurance**: Your building insurance should be active from the date of settlement
- **Organise utility connections**: Arrange for electricity, gas, water, and internet to be connected in your name

### On Settlement Day

- **Stay available**: Your conveyancer or broker may need to reach you if any last-minute issues arise
- **Wait for confirmation**: You'll receive a call or message from your conveyancer once settlement has been completed
- **Collect the keys**: Usually from the real estate agent's office once settlement is confirmed

## Common Settlement Delays

Settlement doesn't always go smoothly. Some common issues include:

- **Late bank paperwork**: If the lender's documents aren't ready on time
- **Outstanding rates or levies**: Unpaid council rates or body corporate fees by the seller
- **Condition issues**: Problems found during the final inspection that need resolving
- **Title issues**: Discrepancies in the title or unregistered caveats

If settlement is delayed, your conveyancer will negotiate with the other party to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## What Happens After Settlement

Once settlement is confirmed:

1. **You own the property** — congratulations!
2. **Your loan repayments begin** — typically on the first scheduled date after settlement
3. **Keys are released** — collect them from the agent
4. **Title is registered** — the land titles office updates ownership records
