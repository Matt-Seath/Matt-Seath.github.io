Your first home served you well, but life has changed. Maybe you need more space for a growing family, want to be closer to work or schools, or you've simply outgrown your current place. Upgrading to your next home is an exciting step — but it requires careful planning to get the finance right.

## Should You Sell First or Buy First?

This is one of the biggest decisions upgraders face, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.

### Selling First

**Pros:**
- You know exactly how much you have to spend
- No risk of paying two mortgages at once
- Stronger negotiating position when buying (no pressure to settle quickly)

**Cons:**
- You may need to rent temporarily between selling and buying
- You could miss out on your ideal property while waiting to sell

### Buying First

**Pros:**
- You can take your time finding the right property
- No need for temporary accommodation

**Cons:**
- You may need bridging finance to cover both properties
- Higher financial risk if your current home takes longer to sell than expected

### Simultaneous Settlement

In some cases, you can align the settlement dates so you sell and buy on the same day. This requires careful coordination between your conveyancer, agents, and broker — but it eliminates the need for bridging finance or temporary housing.

## Using Your Equity

If your current home has increased in value, your equity can form the deposit for your next property. Here's how it works:

1. **Get your home valued**: Your broker can arrange a market appraisal or formal valuation
2. **Calculate your usable equity**: Most lenders allow you to borrow up to 80% of your home's value, minus what you still owe
3. **Use equity as your deposit**: This means you may not need to save a separate deposit for your next home

**Example**: Your home is worth $700,000 and you owe $350,000. Your usable equity is up to $210,000 (80% of $700,000 = $560,000, minus $350,000 owing).

## Costs to Factor In

When upgrading, don't forget these additional costs:

- **Stamp duty**: Payable on your new purchase (first home concessions no longer apply)
- **Agent fees**: Typically 2-2.5% of your sale price
- **Conveyancing fees**: For both the sale and the purchase
- **Moving costs**: Removalists, storage, and temporary accommodation if needed
- **Loan costs**: Application fees, valuation fees, and potential LMI if your LVR is above 80%

## Bridging Finance Explained

If you buy before you sell, bridging finance allows you to borrow against both properties for a short period (usually up to 6-12 months). Once your existing property sells, the bridging loan is paid off and you revert to a standard home loan on the new property.

Bridging loans can be useful but come with higher interest rates and the risk of carrying two debts. Your broker can help you assess whether this is the right option.

## Planning Your Upgrade

1. **Talk to your broker early**: Understand your borrowing capacity before you start looking
2. **Get your current home market-ready**: Small improvements can boost your sale price
3. **Research your target area**: Know what properties are selling for so you can plan your budget
4. **Align your timelines**: Work with your broker and conveyancer to coordinate selling and buying
5. **Review your loan structure**: Your next loan may need different features than your first
