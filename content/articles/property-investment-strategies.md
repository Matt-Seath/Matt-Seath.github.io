Property investment remains one of the most popular wealth-building strategies in Australia. But with so many approaches available, knowing where to start can feel overwhelming. Here are five strategies every beginner investor should understand.

## 1. Buy and Hold

The most straightforward strategy — purchase a property, rent it out, and hold it long-term while it appreciates in value. This is ideal for investors who want steady rental income and long-term capital growth without the complexity of active management.

**Best for**: Patient investors with a long-term outlook (10+ years).

## 2. Negative Gearing

Negative gearing occurs when your rental income is less than your property expenses (loan interest, maintenance, management fees). The loss can be offset against your taxable income, reducing your overall tax bill.

While this strategy provides tax benefits, it's important to remember that you're still making a loss in the short term. The goal is for capital growth to outweigh those losses over time.

**Best for**: Higher-income earners looking for tax advantages alongside capital growth.

## 3. Positive Cash Flow

The opposite of negative gearing — your rental income exceeds your expenses. These properties are harder to find in capital cities but can be more common in regional areas or high-yield locations.

**Best for**: Investors who want their property to pay for itself from day one.

## 4. Renovate and Add Value

Purchase a property below market value, renovate it strategically, and increase both its rental yield and market value. This doesn't have to mean a full renovation — sometimes cosmetic updates like new paint, flooring, and landscaping can make a significant difference.

**Best for**: Hands-on investors who can identify undervalued properties.

## 5. Using Equity to Grow Your Portfolio

Once your existing property has increased in value, you can use the built-up equity as a deposit for your next investment. This allows you to grow your portfolio without saving an entirely new deposit from scratch.

For example, if your home is worth $800,000 and you owe $500,000, you have $300,000 in equity. A lender may allow you to access up to 80% of your property's value, giving you usable equity of around $140,000.

**Best for**: Existing homeowners looking to expand into investment property.

## Getting Your Finance Right

The right loan structure can make or break an investment property. Considerations include:

- **Interest-only vs principal and interest**: Interest-only loans keep repayments lower in the early years
- **Separate loans**: Keep your investment loan separate from your home loan for tax purposes
- **Fixed vs variable**: Each has trade-offs depending on your strategy
- **Offset accounts**: Can help reduce interest while maintaining access to funds
