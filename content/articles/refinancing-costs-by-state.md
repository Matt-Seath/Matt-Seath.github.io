Refinancing your home loan can save you thousands in interest, but it's not free. Understanding the full cost of switching helps you make a smart decision — and avoid surprises.

## Typical Costs When Refinancing

Refinancing involves closing your existing loan and taking out a new one. You'll encounter a mix of lender fees, legal costs, and government charges. Overall costs typically range from $500 to $2,000+ — though fixed-rate break costs can push this much higher.

### Common Refinancing Fees

| Fee | Typical Range | Who Charges It |
|---|---|---|
| Discharge (exit) fee | $150–$700 | Your current lender |
| Application/establishment fee | $0–$1,000+ (often waived) | New lender |
| Valuation fee | $0–$600 | New lender or valuer |
| Settlement/legal fee | $100–$1,000 | New lender or conveyancer |
| Mortgage registration fee | $115–$250 per event | State/Territory government |
| Title search/admin | $50–$100 | Lender or government |
| Break costs (fixed rate only) | Varies widely | Current lender |
| Lenders Mortgage Insurance | Varies | If new LVR exceeds 80% |

Many lenders waive application and valuation fees as an incentive for switching — and some offer cashback deals that can offset most or all of your upfront costs.

## Government Fees by State and Territory

When you refinance to a new lender, you generally pay two sets of government registration fees — one to remove the old mortgage (discharge) and one to register the new one. These are set by each state and territory.

### Approximate Mortgage Registration and Discharge Fees (2025–2026)

| State/Territory | Registration Fee | Discharge Fee | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| NSW | ~$172 | ~$172 | ~$344 |
| QLD | ~$232 | ~$232 | ~$464 |
| VIC | ~$118–$129 | ~$118–$129 | ~$236–$258 |
| WA | ~$203 | ~$203 | ~$406 |
| SA | ~$187 | ~$187 | ~$374 |
| TAS | ~$152–$189 | ~$152–$189 | ~$304–$378 |
| ACT | ~$165–$172 | ~$165–$172 | ~$330–$344 |
| NT | ~$165–$172 | ~$165–$172 | ~$330–$344 |

These government fees are statutory and non-negotiable — unlike lender fees, which can often be waived or reduced.

## Cost Drivers That Can Make Refinancing More Expensive

### Break Costs on Fixed Rate Loans

If you exit a fixed-rate loan before the fixed period ends, your current lender may charge a break fee to compensate for lost interest. This can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands — depending on the remaining term and the difference between your fixed rate and current market rates.

Always ask your current lender for a break cost estimate before refinancing.

### Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)

If your property has decreased in value (or you've increased your borrowing) and your new LVR exceeds 80%, you may need to pay LMI again. This is a significant cost and can make refinancing uneconomical in some cases.

## Does It Make Financial Sense to Refinance?

Refinancing makes sense when the savings outweigh the costs. Here's how to work it out.

### When Refinancing Does Make Sense

- You can secure a rate that's 0.20–0.50% (or more) lower than your current rate
- You'll keep the loan long enough to recoup the upfront costs
- You need to change your loan structure (e.g., from interest-only to principal & interest, or to add an offset account)
- A cashback offer covers most or all of the switching costs

### When Refinancing Makes Less Sense

- The rate improvement is small relative to fees
- You're early in a fixed-rate term and face large break costs
- You don't plan to keep the loan long enough to recover costs
- Your LVR has risen above 80%, triggering LMI

### The Breakeven Calculation

Here's a simple way to decide:

**Breakeven (months) = Total refinance costs / Monthly savings**

**Example**: Your refinance costs total $1,500, and your new rate saves you $250 per month in interest.

$1,500 / $250 = 6 months to break even

If you plan to keep the loan for longer than 6 months, the refinance is worth it.

### Should You Refinance Frequently?

Frequent refinancing simply to chase the lowest rate often isn't worthwhile. The incremental savings can be eaten up by fees — unless you can heavily negotiate fees down or receive cashback offers that cover them.

A good rule of thumb is to review your loan annually and consider refinancing when:

- Your rate is noticeably above market
- Your circumstances have changed (higher income, more equity)
- Your current lender won't match competitive offers
- A compelling cashback deal is available
