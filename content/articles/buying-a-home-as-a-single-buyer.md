Buying a home on a single income might seem daunting, but thousands of Australians do it every year. With the right planning and the right loan, solo buyers can absolutely get into the property market — and build wealth on their own terms.

## How Does Borrowing Power Work for Single Buyers?

Lenders assess your borrowing capacity based on your income, expenses, debts, and deposit. As a single applicant, you have one income stream, which typically means a lower borrowing capacity compared to a couple — but that doesn't mean you can't buy.

Factors that help maximise your borrowing power:

- **Low existing debts**: Paying off personal loans, car loans, and credit cards before applying
- **Clean credit history**: Consistent repayment history shows lenders you're reliable
- **Stable income**: Permanent full-time employment is viewed most favourably, though other income types are considered
- **Minimal living expenses**: Lenders assess your declared expenses against benchmarks

## Strategies for Single Buyers

### 1. Start With What You Can Afford

You don't need to buy your dream home first. Many single buyers start with an apartment or townhouse and upgrade later as their equity and income grow.

### 2. Take Advantage of Government Schemes

Single buyers are fully eligible for all first home buyer incentives:

- **First Home Owner Grant**: Available in most states for eligible purchases
- **Home Guarantee Scheme**: Buy with as little as 5% deposit without LMI — places are allocated specifically for single buyers
- **Stamp duty concessions**: Reduced or waived in many states for first home buyers
- **First Home Super Saver Scheme**: Salary sacrifice into super and withdraw for your deposit with tax benefits

### 3. Consider a Guarantor

A family member can act as a guarantor by offering their property as additional security. This can help you avoid LMI and borrow more than your deposit alone would allow. The guarantor doesn't give you money — they provide security that reduces the lender's risk.

### 4. Look at Different Locations

If your budget is tight in your preferred suburb, consider nearby areas that offer better value. Proximity to transport, schools, and amenities can mean strong growth potential even in more affordable suburbs.

### 5. Get Pre-Approved Early

Pre-approval gives you a clear picture of your budget and shows vendors you're a serious buyer. This is especially important as a solo buyer — you want to move confidently when you find the right property.

## Common Concerns for Solo Buyers

**"What if interest rates go up?"**
Budget for rate rises by stress-testing your repayments. If you can comfortably afford repayments at 2% above your current rate, you'll be well positioned.

**"What if I lose my job?"**
Building an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before buying provides a safety net. Income protection insurance is also worth considering.

**"Should I wait until I'm earning more?"**
Waiting means property prices may also rise. Getting into the market sooner — even with a smaller property — lets you start building equity.
