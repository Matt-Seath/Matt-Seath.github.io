When it's time to get a home loan, many people head straight to their bank. It makes sense — you already have an account there and they know your finances. But there's a reason more than two-thirds of Australian home loans are now written through mortgage brokers. Here's why.

## What Does a Mortgage Broker Actually Do?

A mortgage broker acts as a middleman between you and lenders. Instead of you approaching banks one by one, your broker compares loans across a wide panel of lenders — including major banks, smaller banks, credit unions, and non-bank lenders — to find the best option for your situation.

They handle the research, paperwork, and negotiations so you don't have to.

## The Advantages of Using a Broker

### Access to More Options

Your bank can only offer you their own products. A broker typically has access to 30-50+ lenders and hundreds of loan products. This means you're far more likely to find a competitive rate and the right loan features.

### It's Free for You

In most cases, mortgage brokers are paid a commission by the lender — not by you. You get professional advice and loan comparison at no cost.

### They Save You Time

Instead of filling out multiple applications and comparing products yourself, your broker does the legwork. They know which lenders suit different borrower profiles and can steer you away from lenders likely to decline your application.

### Expert Guidance Through the Process

From pre-approval to settlement, your broker guides you through every step. They explain the jargon, help you understand the fine print, and advocate on your behalf if issues arise.

### They Know the Policies

Every lender has different policies around income types, property types, LVR thresholds, and credit history. A good broker knows these inside out and matches you with the lender most likely to approve your loan on favourable terms.

## When a Broker Is Especially Valuable

- **First home buyers** navigating the process for the first time
- **Self-employed borrowers** whose income is assessed differently
- **Property investors** who need strategic loan structuring
- **Refinancers** wanting to compare their current deal against the market
- **Borrowers with complex situations** such as multiple income sources or existing debts

## Questions to Ask Your Broker

1. How many lenders do you have on your panel?
2. How are you paid, and does it vary by lender?
3. What information do you need from me to get started?
4. How long will the process take?
5. Will you help me through to settlement?
