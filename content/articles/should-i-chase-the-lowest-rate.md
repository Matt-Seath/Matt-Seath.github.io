It's tempting to sort home loans by interest rate and pick the cheapest one. After all, a lower rate means lower repayments, right? While that's technically true, the lowest rate loan isn't always the best loan for your situation.

## Why the Lowest Rate Can Be Misleading

A headline rate only tells part of the story. Some ultra-low rate loans come with trade-offs that can cost you more in the long run.

### Limited Features

The cheapest rate loans are often "basic" or "no frills" products. They may lack:

- **Offset accounts**: An offset account can save you thousands in interest over the life of your loan
- **Redraw facilities**: The ability to access extra repayments you've made
- **Extra repayment flexibility**: Some basic loans cap or penalise additional repayments

For example, a loan at 5.99% with a full offset account could actually cost you less overall than a loan at 5.79% without one — especially if you keep a healthy balance in your offset.

### Hidden Fees

Some low-rate loans make up the difference with higher fees:

- **Annual package fees**: $300–$400 per year is common
- **Application or establishment fees**: Can be $500–$1,000+
- **Discharge fees**: Charged when you eventually leave the loan

Always look at the **comparison rate**, which factors in most fees and gives you a more accurate picture of the true cost.

### Restrictions That Cost You Later

Some low-rate products lock you in with:

- Limited ability to switch between fixed and variable
- No ability to split your loan
- Restrictions on making lump sum payments
- Higher break costs if you refinance

## What Should You Compare Instead?

### 1. Total Cost of the Loan

Look beyond the monthly repayment. Calculate the total interest plus fees over the period you expect to hold the loan.

### 2. Features That Match Your Needs

If you have savings sitting in a transaction account, an offset account could save you far more than a 0.10% rate difference. If you receive irregular income (bonuses, commissions), flexible repayment options matter.

### 3. Flexibility for the Future

Your needs will change. A loan that lets you switch between fixed and variable, increase your borrowing, or access equity gives you options down the track.

### 4. Lender Service and Turnaround

A lender with fast approval times and responsive service can make a real difference — especially when you're buying at auction or in a competitive market.

## When the Lowest Rate Does Make Sense

Chasing the rate is more reasonable when:

- You're an investor focused purely on minimising costs
- You have a straightforward loan with no need for extra features
- The rate difference is significant (0.5%+ lower)
- You've confirmed there are no hidden fees eating into the savings

## A Smarter Approach

Rather than chasing the absolute lowest rate, focus on finding the **best value loan** for your specific situation. That means weighing the rate against features, fees, flexibility, and your own financial habits.
