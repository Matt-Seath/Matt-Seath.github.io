If you've been watching the property market, you've probably noticed that prices don't just go up in a straight line. They rise, flatten, sometimes dip, and then rise again. These movements are known as property market cycles, and understanding them can help you make better decisions about when and how to buy.

## The Four Phases of a Property Cycle

### 1. Growth Phase (Boom)

Property prices are rising, buyer demand is strong, and auction clearance rates are high. Media coverage tends to be positive, and there's a sense of urgency in the market. Properties sell quickly, often above the asking price.

**What it means for buyers**: Competition is fierce and prices are at their highest. It's still possible to buy well, but you need to be disciplined with your budget.

### 2. Peak

Price growth begins to slow. The market may still be rising, but the pace of growth starts to cool. Days on market increase slightly, and vendors become more flexible on price.

**What it means for buyers**: This can be a risky time to overpay if you assume growth will continue at the same pace.

### 3. Correction Phase (Slowdown)

Prices flatten or decline. Buyer demand drops, listings may increase, and sellers have to adjust their expectations. Interest rate rises often contribute to this phase.

**What it means for buyers**: There may be opportunities to negotiate and buy below market value. Less competition at auctions and more time to make decisions.

### 4. Recovery Phase (Trough)

Prices stabilise and begin to rise again. Early buyers start re-entering the market, and confidence slowly returns. This is often considered the best time to buy.

**What it means for buyers**: Historically, buying during recovery has delivered the strongest long-term returns.

## What Drives Property Cycles?

Several factors influence where the market sits in its cycle:

- **Interest rates**: Lower rates increase borrowing power and push prices up; higher rates do the opposite
- **Supply and demand**: Population growth, new housing construction, and migration all play a role
- **Economic conditions**: Employment levels, wage growth, and consumer confidence affect buyer behaviour
- **Government policy**: Changes to grants, stamp duty, lending regulations, and tax policy can shift the market
- **Lending conditions**: How easily banks are willing to lend has a direct impact on buyer demand

## Should You Try to Time the Market?

The short answer: probably not. While understanding cycles is valuable, trying to perfectly time the bottom of a market is extremely difficult — even for experts.

What matters more for most buyers is:

- **Buying within your means**: A loan you can comfortably service regardless of rate changes
- **Holding for the long term**: Property has historically doubled in value roughly every 7-10 years in major Australian cities
- **Buying the right property**: Location, land value, and growth potential matter more than timing
- **Getting the right finance**: The right loan structure can save you tens of thousands over time
