You've been saving hard and have more than enough for a 20% deposit. Should you put down 25%, 30%, or even more? It sounds like a good problem to have — and it is — but the answer isn't as straightforward as you might think.

## The Benefits of a Bigger Deposit

### Lower Repayments

The less you borrow, the lower your monthly repayments. On a $600,000 property:

| Deposit | Loan Amount | Monthly Repayment (6% over 30 years) |
|---|---|---|
| 20% ($120,000) | $480,000 | ~$2,878 |
| 25% ($150,000) | $450,000 | ~$2,698 |
| 30% ($180,000) | $420,000 | ~$2,518 |

That's a difference of about $360 per month between a 20% and 30% deposit.

### Less Interest Over the Life of the Loan

A smaller loan means significantly less total interest:

- $480,000 loan at 6% over 30 years = ~$556,000 in interest
- $420,000 loan at 6% over 30 years = ~$486,000 in interest
- **Saving: ~$70,000** in total interest

### Potentially Better Rates

Some lenders offer sharper interest rates for borrowers with lower LVRs. You may unlock a better rate tier at 70% LVR compared to 80%.

## The Risks of Putting Everything In

### You May Need That Cash Later

Life is unpredictable. Once your deposit is locked into your property, you can't easily access it. Consider what you might need funds for:

- **Emergency buffer**: 3–6 months of expenses is recommended
- **Moving and settling-in costs**: Furniture, repairs, utilities setup
- **Property maintenance**: Unexpected repairs can be costly
- **Other debts**: Higher-interest debts (credit cards, personal loans) should typically be cleared first

### Opportunity Cost

That extra cash could potentially earn more working for you elsewhere:

- **Offset account**: Keeping extra funds in an offset account gives you the same interest savings as putting it in the deposit — but you can access it anytime
- **Investments**: If your expected return on investments exceeds your mortgage rate (after tax), investing the surplus may make more sense
- **Renovations**: Strategic improvements to a property can increase its value by more than the renovation cost

### You're Locked In

Extra money in your deposit is equity you can't touch without refinancing or selling. An offset account achieves the same interest reduction while keeping your money accessible.

## The Offset Account Alternative

This is often the best of both worlds. Instead of putting 30% down as a deposit, consider:

1. Put down 20% as your deposit (avoiding LMI)
2. Keep the extra 10% in a **full offset account**

You'll pay the same amount of interest as if you'd put down 30%, but you can access that money at any time for emergencies, opportunities, or unexpected costs.

**Example**: $60,000 sitting in an offset account against a 6% home loan effectively earns you 6% tax-free — because it's reducing the interest you pay. That's better than most savings accounts.

## When a Bigger Deposit Makes Sense

- You don't have an offset account available on your loan
- You want the certainty of lower fixed repayments
- You're an investor and want to maximise rental yield relative to repayments
- You already have a separate emergency fund and other investments

## When You Should Keep Cash Aside

- You're buying your first home and may face unexpected costs
- You have access to an offset account
- You have higher-interest debts that could be paid off first
- You want to keep cash available for renovations or improvements
- Your income is variable and you want a financial safety net
