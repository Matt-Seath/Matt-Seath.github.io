CloudLogic is the “Cloud” based version of a Dealer Solutions application called DealerLogic. (Read more [**here**](https://www.coxautoretail.com.au/products-services/dms/ "https://www.coxautoretail.com.au/products-services/dms/")).

DealerLogic is setup by installing a “server” version of the application locally on a dealer’s network and then users login using a local version of DealerLogic on each desktop. IT do not support DealerLogic, it is handled by the respective developers.

CloudLogic makes use of a simple Remote Desktop Services application, which allows a dealer’s DealerLogic app to be installed on one of two AWS servers run in the Dealer Solutions' legacy AWS account. From there, a dealer can then login via the [**portal**](https://cloudlogicportal.dealersolutions.com.au/RDWeb/Pages/en-US/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/RDWeb/Pages/en-US/Default.aspx "https://cloudlogicportal.dealersolutions.com.au/RDWeb/Pages/en-US/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/RDWeb/Pages/en-US/Default.aspx") with their provided username and password which then connects them to their DealerLogic instance hosted in the “Cloud”.

IT support CloudLogic in a couple of ways:

1.  Managing CloudLogic users. You can find a guide [**here**](https://dealersolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSK/pages/4735991884 "/wiki/spaces/CSK/pages/4735991884") for creating new users for existing clients and you can find a guide [**here**](https://dealersolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSK/pages/4735696981 "/wiki/spaces/CSK/pages/4735696981") for a guide to disable users.
    
2.  IT are responsible for setting up new Clients in CloudLogic. This is a more involved process, but a guide can be followed **here**.
