There are 4 valid concessions for STE, these are:
- Ex-Serviceperson
- Local/Semi Government
- Government
- Qualifying Institutes


## Ex-Serviceperson
These are individuals granted Stamp Duty Exemption from the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Typically they are known as TPI, Totally and Permanently incapacitated by more than 70% or be assessed to have at least 50 impairment points to be eligible.  As such, they are issued with one of two letters from the Department of Veterans Affairs (see example).  

The exemption category you will select is ‘Ex-Serviceperson’ from the combo on the Rego Detail tab.  You will note that when ex-serviceperson is selected, the concessional registration category (ex serviceperson) is automatically selected for you.

Copies of the transaction paperwork and a copy of either of the letters needs to be included with your TRAILS filing.

Please be advised that Ex-Service Persons are exempt from re-establishing their eligibility on subsequent applications. If an eligible customer does not have a letter from the DVA, dealerships can contact their Approved Service Provider to enquire as to whether the customer has already established their eligibility. As per concession conditions, only one concession is allowed between spouses for one vehicle and one recreational ship.

## Local/Semi Government Stamp Duty exemption and Concession
When Local Semi Government Concession is applied in a transaction the Stamp Duty exemption gets picked up automatically due to the concession ‘Qual’ attached to the CRN.   
If they have LGOV/SGOV attached to the crn they are using then there is never a need to enter any Stamp Duty Exemption reason in the transaction.   
Qualifying Institute would never be used along with Local Semi Government Concession.  No supporting documentation required – all recorded on the CRN.

## Government Stamp Duty Exemption only
Various  government departments may have ‘Quals’ attached to their crns and again will attract automatic Stamp Duty exemption with out the operator having to enter anything in the Stamp Duty exemption field.  ‘Quals’ are as follows – GOVT, LGOV (as above), FGOV, CGOV, SGOV (as above).  No supporting documentation required – all recorded on the CRN. 

GOVT = Government Department   
LGOV = Local Government  
FGOV = Federal Government  
SGOV = Semi Government Body  
CGOV = Commonwealth Government Authority

## Qualifying Institute Stamp Duty Exemption reason
Operator has to provide dealership with Qualifying Use Statement AND notice of registration to apply this exemption.  
- NOTE: This does NOT go hand in hand with concession - Charitable and community service concessions must be checked with DS before adding to transaction
