## Overview

Bucket-O-Stuff is intended as an inbox for new work which Product Managers will then triage and decide on the course of action to for the work.  It is to prevent requests simply making there way into product lanes and being action without the approval of a Product Manager.  Any P1 and P2 should also be submitted to Bucket-O-Stuff and then the [P1 & P2 Internal Communication Standards](https://dealersolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JIRA/pages/712739332) document followed in order to handle the P1 or P2.

Work should not be executed on a Bucket-O-Stuff case, the case should be moved to the appropriate Jira product lane project as soon as it has been acknowledged that work is required, with P1s and P2s following their standard workflow and other work being planned into sprints while being mindful to the product lanes initiatives.  Moving he case into the appropriate Jira project will ensure that the correct workflow is executed within that Jira project and ensure accurate reporting for the project.
