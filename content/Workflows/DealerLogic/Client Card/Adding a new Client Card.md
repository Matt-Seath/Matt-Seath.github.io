Adding a new Client Card displays the Summary Client Card Screen.  **This screen enables you to enter a minimum of information to establish a new card whilst at the same time providing enough information to make the card relevant when saved.**  This gives you the flexibility to quickly add a card ‘on the fly’ and complete the less critical information later (if you want to).

To an experienced user most fields on this screen are self-explanatory however Dealerlogic has an intuitive way of interpreting addresses that you may wish to experiment with.

Adding addresses has never been quicker or easier.  Simply enter the street number and name followed by the suburb or town and Tab off the field.  The software will complete the rest for you.

Postal addresses are added in the same way however if the postal address, street address and garaging address are identical you can simply press the Same as Street to complete the details for you.

**Adding a Joint Owner or Registered Operator can also be performed from the same Summary Client card Screen.**

**Driver’s Licence Numbers (private person)  or CRN’s for Organisations should be entered.**

**For Organisations you should record ABN’s, A.C.N’s or Business Numbers and if the Client card you are creating is for a Motor Dealer it is very important to tick the field Motor Dealer.**

To add a Joint Owner or Registered Operator click the second Tab at the top of the Summary Client Card Screen.  This tab will be named either Joint Owner or Registered Operator depending on whether your initial selection was for an either Individual or Organisation.

If the majority of the details for your Joint Owner or Registered Operator are the same as the main Individual or Organisation simply press the Copy from main button to fill the card in for you.  Note the different card numbers for the Main and Joint owner.

**Special Note: If you have added either a Joint Owner or Registered Operator in the Summary Client Card Screen, on saving the summary, the software will generate two individual Client Cards and join them with a unique relationship.**

The two Client Cards created as a result will appear individually in the Card Locate Window and display the Joint owner relationship under the Contacts Tab of each card.
