While you can reprocess a transaction electronically if you invalidate it within 21 days, if your original transaction date is beyond 21 days, you will need to submit reprocessing paperwork to have the transaction corrected by QT.  It is important to remember that you will need to provide evidence of your error, so ensure that you have this first before starting your invalidation.

1. Highlight the completed transaction in your dais transactions box and either right click and select invalidate transaction or select Invalidate Transaction on the bottom right hand corner of the transactions box.

2. A pop up window will appear to tell you the request will be sent to Dealer Solutions for approval and processing

    - Click on OK.

3. A Transaction Invalidation Request box will then appear with the transaction information and a field called REASON for you to record the reason for invalidation.  You have the option to selection multiple reasons if you need to.  It is very important that you tell us about ALL the reasons you want to invalidate a transaction for – as this will determine which fields you are able to modify in your finalized transaction.

4. Once a reason is entered the requirements for that invalidation reason will appear below the Lodge request box.  Read the requirements and ensure that you have made any required statements in the Explanation field e.g. If the vehicle has not left the dealership or not and are aware of any paperwork that may be necessary to fax/email to Dealer Solutions.

5. Lodge Request.
