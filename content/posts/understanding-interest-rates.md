Interest rates are one of the most important factors in your home loan. Even a small difference in rate can mean tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan. Understanding how they work can help you make smarter borrowing decisions.

## How Home Loan Interest Works

When you borrow money to buy a home, you repay the principal (the amount borrowed) plus interest (the cost of borrowing). Most home loans in Australia charge interest daily and debit it monthly.

For example, on a $500,000 loan at 6% p.a. over 30 years:
- Monthly repayment: approximately $3,000
- Total interest paid: approximately $579,000
- Total amount repaid: approximately $1,079,000

## What Influences Interest Rates?

### The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
The RBA sets the official cash rate, which directly influences the interest rates banks offer. When the cash rate goes up, home loan rates typically follow.

### Your Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)
The lower your LVR (meaning the more deposit you have), the lower your interest rate is likely to be. Borrowers with an LVR of 60% or less often get the best rates.

### Your Credit Score
A strong credit history demonstrates to lenders that you're a reliable borrower, which can help you secure a better rate.

### Loan Type and Features
Basic loans with fewer features often come with lower rates. Loans with offset accounts, redraw facilities, and other features may have slightly higher rates.

## Fixed vs Variable: Which Is Right for You?

**Variable rates** move with the market. They offer flexibility (extra repayments, offset accounts) but your repayments can change.

**Fixed rates** are locked in for a set period. They offer certainty but may come with restrictions and break costs if you want to refinance early.

**Split loans** let you fix a portion and keep the rest variable — giving you the best of both worlds.

## Tips for Getting the Best Rate

1. **Save a larger deposit**: The more you put down, the better your rate
2. **Clean up your credit**: Pay off debts and avoid late payments before applying
3. **Use a mortgage broker**: Brokers have access to a wide panel of lenders and can negotiate on your behalf
4. **Don't just look at the rate**: Consider comparison rates, which include fees and charges
5. **Review regularly**: Rates change, and loyalty to your bank doesn't always pay off
