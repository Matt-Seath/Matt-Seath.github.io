Purchasing your first home is one of the most significant financial decisions you'll ever make. Whether you're just starting to think about it or you're ready to start inspecting properties, this guide will help you understand the key steps involved.

## Understanding Your Borrowing Power

Before you start browsing listings, it's crucial to understand how much you can borrow. Lenders assess your borrowing capacity based on several factors:

- **Income**: Your gross salary and any additional income sources
- **Expenses**: Your living expenses, existing debts, and financial commitments
- **Deposit**: The amount you've saved for a deposit (typically 5-20% of the property value)
- **Credit history**: Your track record of repaying debts

> A mortgage broker can help you understand your borrowing power without impacting your credit score.

## Government Grants and Incentives

As a first home buyer in Australia, you may be eligible for several government incentives:

- **First Home Owner Grant (FHOG)**: A one-off grant available in most states
- **Stamp duty concessions**: Reduced or waived stamp duty for eligible buyers
- **First Home Super Saver Scheme**: Use voluntary super contributions towards your deposit
- **Home Guarantee Scheme**: Purchase with as little as 5% deposit without paying LMI

## Choosing the Right Loan

There are several types of home loans to consider:

### Variable Rate Loans
The interest rate can go up or down with market conditions. These loans offer flexibility and often come with features like offset accounts and redraw facilities.

### Fixed Rate Loans
The interest rate is locked in for a set period (usually 1-5 years). This provides certainty about your repayments but may come with restrictions.

### Split Loans
A combination of fixed and variable rates, giving you both certainty and flexibility.

## The Application Process

1. **Get pre-approved**: This gives you a clear budget and shows sellers you're serious
2. **Find your property**: Attend inspections and do your research
3. **Make an offer**: Your agent or conveyancer can help with this
4. **Formal approval**: The lender will assess the property and finalise your application
5. **Settlement**: The property officially becomes yours
